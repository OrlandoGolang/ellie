# Contributing

Thank a lot for showing interest in making Ellie better!

## 1. Create an Issue / Proposal

Create a github issue detailing the bug or enhancement you would like to work on.

The project admins will evaluate your proposal and flag as `approved` or `not approved`

**Note**

	Pull requests that do not have a corresponding, approved issue will be rejected.

## 2. Fork, Develop, and Issue Pull Request

When you finished developing your fix or enhancement, issue a pull request
against the `develop` branch of the base fork. In your pull request, be sure
to reference the corresponding issue via #issue-number (ex. \#24).

Then, be on the lookout for feedback from the contributors, or a merge
complete notification!
